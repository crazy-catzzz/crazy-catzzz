- 👋 Hi! I’m @miao704g, a still-not-a-programmer who uses GitHub to archive tests and even some actually released stuff.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new programming languages and ***drawing***
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3.9 and Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on probably noMS-Volume-Activator since it would be written in Python and I'm really bad at it
- 📫 How to reach me... ***you can't***
